            <div id="colonandsemicolon">There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons you can think of them as <span id="commas">commas</span> and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as <a href="../periods/index.html"> periods</a> and then using them can make you feel adventurous. </div> 
            <div id ="explanation">I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never have, I began unfortunately to feel them as a <span id="commadefinition"><u>comma</u></span> <span id="commadefinitionrevealed"><u> and commas are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience </u></span> and they are put there just for practical purposes.</div> <br><br>
            
            <div id ="colondefinition"> Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely this character the character that a comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore and definitely I have never used them. But now dimly and definitely I do see that they <span id="error"> might well possibly they might </span> <span id="correction">*maybe </span>have in them something of the character of the period and so <span id="contradictions"><u>it might have been an adventure to use them.</span><span id="replacementcontradiction"> I really do not think so.</u></span> </div>
            <div id ="reasons"> I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely more comma than period and so really I cannot regret not having used them. They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but they are a comma all the same. They really have within them deeply <span id="repetition"> within them fundamentally within them </span> the <span id="comma2">comma</span> nature. </div><br><br>
            <div id="conclusion"> And now what does a <a href="../commas/index.html" id="comma3"> comma </a> do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them. </div>
