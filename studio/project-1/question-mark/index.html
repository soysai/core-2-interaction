        <div class ="intro">The question mark is alright when it <span id="replaced"><u>is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration</u></span> <span id="replace"><u>is all alone<br>is used as a brand on cattle <br> is used as decoration</u></span> but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely <span id="font-change"><i>uninteresting.</i></span> </div>

        <div class="explanation" id="explanation">It is evident that <span class ="spell-errors" id="spell-error-1">is</span> <span id="correction-1">*if</span> you ask a <span id="question"><u>question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing.</u></span> <span id="question-replaced"><u>question, it is already implied it is a question. Hence, the mark at the end is just redundant.</u></span> Therefore I ask you <span class ="spell-errors" id= "spell-error-2">therefore wherefore</span><span id="correction-2">*wherefore</span> should one use the question mark.
        Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a <span id="font-change-2">noun</span></div> 
        
        <div id="definition"><span class="noun-title">"noun"</span><br><span class="noun">[just an unnecessary name of something]</span><br><span id="back"> <<< </span></div>

        <div id="down">again,</div>

        <div id="repetition">A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing. Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, <span id="spell-error-3"> and now very few do use it </span><span id="correction-3">*and now use very few of it.</span> </div>

        <div id ="other_punctuations"> There are problems with other punctuation marks too,</div>

        <div id="punctuation_mark"> <span id="opening"><span id="exclamation_mark"><u>Exclamation marks </u></span><span id="quotation_mark"><u>and also quotation marks,</u></span> have the same <span id="difficulty">difficulty</span></span> <br>

        <div id="repetition-2">if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question. The same thing is true of a <span id ="segue"><i> quotation.</i></span></div>
        
       <div id="thoughts"> <span id="thoughts_initial">When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points and now <span id="replaced-2"><u>anybody sees it that way. </u></span>

        <div id="uninteresting">So there are the <span id="highlight_again">uninteresting</span>  things in punctuation. </div>
        <div id="uninteresting_clarification">uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that. <br>
        There are besides dashes and dots, and these might be <span id="present"><u>interesting spaces might be interesting.</span> <span id="hidden"> interesting.
